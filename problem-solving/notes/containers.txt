C++ containers
  - Sequence containers
    - Arrays
      - Contiguous memory cells
      - Supports random access
    - Lists
      - Dynamically memory
      - Does not support random access
    - Vectors
      - Arrays
      - Supports random access
    - Deque
      - Arrays (multiple arrays/circular arrays)
      - Supports random access
  - Associative containers
    - Map
    - Set
    - Multimap
    - Multiset
  - Unordered associative containers
    - Unordered map
    - Unordered set
    - Unordered multimap
    - Unordered multiset
  - Container adapters
    - Stack
      - Any sequence container; by default: deque
      - No random access, no search, only push, pop and top
    - Queue
      - Any sequence container; by default: deque
      - No random access, no search, only push, pop, back, front
    - Priority queue
      - Any sequence container; by default: vector. A heap is created
      - Like heap but push, pop, back, front
